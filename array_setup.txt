Solver will interpret the cube using two arrays, one on the cubie level, and one on the facelet level.
The Cubie array is a 3 dimensional array, the third level of the array denotes each layer, which is numbered 0-2, corresponding to the U, E, and D layers.
The Facelet array is a 3 dimensional array, the third level of the array denotes each face of the cube, which is numbered 0-5, corresponding to U, D, L, R, F, and B faces.
Cube will be assumed to be in WCA scramble position, white on top, green on front.
White face is ordered from back to front, with green in front.
RGBO faces are ordered from top to bottom, with white on top.
Yellow face is ordered from back to front, after performing a x2 move, putting blue in front and yellow on top.
'i' (inverse) moves rotate counter-clockwise instead of clockwise.
Naming convention for cubies will be as follows:
    Edges:
        2 letters
        Order will be: W/Y, B/G, R/O
    Corners:
        3 letters
        Each place will maintain each pair of sides.
        i.e. [W/Y][B/G][R/O]
    Centers will be definied with a single letter, even though their position will remain constant. Equator slice "center" will be notated as C for core.
